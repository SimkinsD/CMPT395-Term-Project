To setup git repository in current directory: git init
To get a remote repository (after git init): git clone user@host:/project/path
  e.g: git clone git@gitlab.com:DecoSimkins/CMPT-395-Term-Project.git

Update local repository: git pull

Add changed file to index (staging area): git add <filename>
  ^ Can be done to index deleted files as well

Add all changed files to index: git add *

Commit changes in index: git commit -m "Commit Message"

Send (push) commits to server: git push <server> <branch-name>

Create branch (locally): git checkout -b <branch-name>
Push branch to remote: git push <server> <branch-name>
Delete branch (locally): git branch -d <branch-name>
Delete branch (remotely): git push --delete <server> <branch-name>

Merge branch into current working branch (Should instead create merge request
  on gitlab website): git merge <branch-name>

In the case of conflicts, after they are resolved, mark them as merged by
  git adding them: git add <resolved-filename>
  (Again, merges should be done through gitlab)
